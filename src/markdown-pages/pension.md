This is something I’ve wrestled within over the past few years. The advice is simple — make sure you pay into a private pension because the state pension isn’t guaranteed to give you any quality of life in retirement other than merely existing.

Now I think generally this is really good advice. But indulge me for a moment while I go into full Tory-politician mode and explain why the rules don’t actually apply to me.

### alright I’m invested, now say something smart to get us on your side..

When you assess something mathematically or scientifically, you often begin with a list of assumptions. The world is a complex mess and you have to simplify any kind of model for us to be able to process it in our puny human brains.

So let’s explore what we think the initial assumptions are for this piece of advice.

_“When you stop working your income will drop significantly”_

…so having a huge pot to draw-down from will see you through the golden years. Most people’s only income is that of their main profession. So understandably if you retire you’re switching off that tap.

_“Its tax efficient to defer pay until retirement”_

Following on from the above assumption then that means you’re almost certain to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire — which means any money you can defer the taxes on until retirement will save you paying it over to her majesty et al.

_“Out of sight out of mind”_

Pensions are locked boxes meaning you can’t squander that money on a Lambo or a speedboat. Once it’s in that pension box, they’ll literally allow you to go bankrupt and still not let you touch it.

So this all sounds reasonable enough right? — and surely good advice for anybody whose primary goal in retirement is to not starve and occasionally be able to visit Benidorm.

But what if we drill down just a tiny little bit into these assumptions when we’re viewing them through the eyes of a property investor.

### Open that cookie jar!

Currently anything in a pension wrapper can be accessed in-part at earliest at age 55.

### Trust

Do you really trust the government to not change that date just as you’re approaching it? Do you think

### Limitations

Pension options are actually much better than they used to be but you’re generally going to have a big pile of money in stocks and bonds, hoping for a 4–7% return on average. COVID is just the latest example of how things totally out of your control can decimate your stock market wealth in an instant.

### Big wins

I’d be remiss here not to mention employer match. To be clear, every time I’ve been offered that my employer will match my pension contributions I’ve taken it. There’s no property I’ve bought yet which will give me a 100% cash return on day one.
Take the match! But sadly in recent I’ve stepped away from being employed by businesses who offer such a thing.

### So go on then, enlighten us.. why are you so special?

If you can build a property business which replaces your income, you’ll hopefully be in a position where you don’t have a sharp decrease in income for rest of your life.

In fact there’s a very good chance your income is only going to go increase with added years.

So all of a sudden.. that means the big pot at 55 means nothing, dropping a tax bracket means nothing because if you’ve built it right your income and wealth should grow year on year.

And if you’re the type of person who has built the assets to create this kind of company — then there’s a good chance you weren’t daft enough to buy that Lambo anyway.

I need my money to be working for me now, so I don’t have to keep working for it forever.

If you’re building assets and wealth intentionally anyway, pension wrappers are one of your many options — and for me an incredibly limited one for what I’m trying to achieve.

### So what, you’ll never pay into a pension?

As your business grows so do your options — every penny counts at the start and you absolutely can’t bare for anything to be locked away. But as you get past certain milestones there becomes more room for diversify outside of your main business.

When that moment comes, I’ll absolutely reassess but for the time being I’m on this crazy rollercoaster, chest out, eyes wide open with no one to blame but myself if I fuck it up.

Who’s with me?
