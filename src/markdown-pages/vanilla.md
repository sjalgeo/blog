When people make their first dramatic entry into property circles, it’s easy to be seduced by all kinds of genius strategies which will make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.

It’ll be no surprise to most that the courses who are training people on these business models, to put it most politely, play down the challenges and downsides in some of these strategies.

And many would argue fair enough, because you didn’t book the training course to find out why you MIGHT NOT end up a millionaire. You’re there to celebrate the crushing inevitability of your impending world domination.

### Weighing your risk

But with each of the more complex strategies you’re taking additional levels of risk, risks which put certain key parts of your business outside your control.

These can range from commercial mortgage companies plucking numbers out of the air to value your property, to requiring an entire merry band of people to run your AirBnB business which could be shut down in a moment by a change in government regulation, a missed clause in a lease or you know… a global pandemic.

Understandably though with people unable to generate sufficient capital quickly enough to participate in the classic buy-to-let model, it’s easy to be seduced by the idea that as long as you put in the effort — you’ll reap the rewards.
Obviously everybody has their own circumstances, but this is how I came to find my focus.

### Start with the end in mind

Property for many, is the vehicle rather than the destination. I once joked with friends that my life long dream was to be AirBnB’s best customer. I want a business I can run from a laptop anywhere in the world. As I develop out this vision it’ll come with numerous challenges I’m sure — but the big picture is that I don’t want my proximity to my properties to be a key factor to my business in the long term.

### Minimising uncertainty

Utilising a ‘buy and hold forever’ strategy generally means you’re in control. Given its a tried and true business model, you’re reducing the risk of anybody pulling the rug from under you.

### Creating a strong platform

Establishing a base of low-risk consistent cashflow will give your business the platform to grow. I’m in a fortunate enough position to generate my own capital as well as having the trust of a small number of investors to continue to grow moving forward.

### Taking calculated risks

As the portfolio grows so does the income it generates, which means the business can afford increased costs. This is what makes the idea of paying interest on investor-lent funds a lot more palatable.

Using investor financing then gives you the opportunity to buy for cash and secure improved deals — and you well and truly make your money when you buy.
The plan may be that you make enough money from the purchase to repay the capital borrowed plus the interest but still having a ‘day job’ along with your rental incomes with you a plan B and plan C.

### There’s no rush

Different circumstances and time-horizons mean each busy property professional has to make their own decisions on how to build a bridge to their goals.
I’m reasonably happy in my day job and although I’d love not to have to work at all (who wouldn’t?), I’ve plotted out my path and I’ve got no one else to blame if I don’t get there.

Once I’ve completed this phase I’ll be in a position to head in any direction I choose, but for now, for me, boring is best.
