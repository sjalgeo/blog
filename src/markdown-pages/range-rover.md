title: "Why a short ride in a Range Rover made me better at managing my property business"
---

I rocked up to site in my scruffy 10 year-old Ford Fiesta. A small group of us had been invited to take a look around the two latest projects of a low-key but prolific investor and businessman in operating in Bradford.

The first a new-build 4 bed HMO which was being built on a barren piece of land connected to another property.

After a short tour, a load of questions and loads of praise we were exiting and ready to head to destination number two.

Parking was limited at the next site so we might want to take fewer cars.

The gentleman in question had rocked up in a big black shiny-ass Range Rover so I felt it was my surely my duty to offer to leave my car behind and jump in with him for the 10-minute journey.

Now don’t get me wrong, this is a hell of a car. If I was rolling around in a vehicle that comfy on a daily basis I’d certainly struggle to not feel like I was some kind of big deal businessman.

But the biggest takeaway from that short journey was that I was missing a huge opportunity to leverage my time.

### Acknowledging your weaknesses

I’m the kind of person who will send emails all day long. Anything on my todo list I can do through my computer gets done, regardless of whether its actually the most important thing I should be focussing on at that moment.

Those tasks however that require me to dial a number into my phone and live actions talk to someone (like its the 90s), end up way down the list and often pushed back or entirely forgotten until absolutely necessary.

I’m constantly battling the anxiety of simply placing a phonecall — no matter how much benefit it could give me or my business or the wider world. I also have a certain level of caution to not be perceived to be blatantly operating my other business in the office — because that’s obviously not what they’re compensating me for.

### Taking care o’ business

During that short journey in what I’d essentially describe as an incredibly comfortable military-grade tank, the driver in question spoke to 2 joiners, an estate agent and a solicitor.

He just smashed it out, got it done. No hesitation. Clearing a pile of things from his mind so he could be fully present when he gave us the tour of his second site.

On the way back he briefly sorted something out with his wife before organising the purchase and pick up of some materials for another project.
I sat there in awe. Mind. Blown.

### Time to go car shopping?

Now at this stage maybe I could have convinced myself that the user-friendly tech in the car made is what made all this possible. I can’t afford this car therefore I can’t be as effective as him. Or maybe I can afford this car? Especially if it’d make me so much more efficient..
It wasn’t the car though. And I knew it.

It was him knowingly or unknowingly leveraging his limited time to smash out his admin.

It slowly sunk in that I was spending untold hours in the car — pretending that I was too busy driving to be able to get lots of these small things done.

### The best money I ever spent

The compromise solution I came up with was a decent pair of bluetooth headphones, ones easy to throw into my ears in the car and zero-fuss pairing with my phone.

Within a few weeks the decks were cleared, phone calls no longer in the backlog and I’d even taken the opportunity to have a few more chats with friends and family I’d been “too busy” to catch up with in the recent past. The sanctity of the car provides me the perfect place to take a deep breathe and talk candidly to those required.

### Finding your Range Rover

Each person has their own daily routine and different opportunities through their day to get things done. Some people just have too much to do and need staff, but for me, I was just not using my time effectively.

I know I won’t be the only person out there who would quite literally do anything else than make a phone call to someone they don’t really know.
But for me anyway the solution was acknowledging that and trying to find a place for it in the daily rollercoaster.
